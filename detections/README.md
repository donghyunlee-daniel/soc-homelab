# Detection Rules

This directory contains reusable Splunk detection queries developed as part of the SOC homelab.

These rules focus on identifying common attack patterns, including:
- SSH brute-force activity
- Successful logins following repeated authentication failures
- Network port scanning behavior

Each `.spl` file is designed to be reused or adapted for alerts and correlation searches.
